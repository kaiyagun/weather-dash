# weather-dash

weather dashboard pulls current and forecasted weather data into a simple dashboard format.

side bar contains search bar, submit button, and links to recently searched cities.

data retrieved from OpenWeather API and measurements are in imperial units.

main dashboard includes temperature, wind, humidity, and uv data for current city, data is from the time of search

lower card deck includes temp, wind, and humidity data for the next 5-day-forecast in searched city. 

recent searches are included in local storage and will remain in list even on page reload
